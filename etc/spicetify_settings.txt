go to ~/.config/spicetify/config.ini

then add ~/.var/app/com.spotify.Client/config/spotify/prefs to the "prefs path" line.

** important ** 
(you might have to replace the ~ with /home/[your username])

and after you've done that put:

sudo chmod a+wr /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.spotify.Client/x86_64/stable/active/files/extra/share/spotify

and

sudo chmod a+wr -R /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.spotify.Client/x86_64/stable/active/files/extra/share/spotify/Apps

in your terminal, then you're all set up! (once you've done spicetify and spicetify update)
